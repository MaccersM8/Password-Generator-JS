# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description
The motivation behind this challenge was to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a program that when ran will generate a random password depending on user input. The parameters of this program are as follows:
- The password must be between 10 and 63 characters
- The password must contain atleast one of the following character types:
    - Special Characters
    - Numerical Characters
    - Upper Cased Charaters
    - Lower Cased Characters

Throughout working on this challenge I have learnt the following:
- JavaScript Manipulative Methods
- JavaScript Iterative Methods
- JavaScript Filtering Methods
- JavaScript Output
- JavaScript Functions

## Usage
In order for the program to run, as a user, you will need to click on the "Generate Password" button. When this button is clicked, the user will be prompted the following:
- Do You Want To Include Special Characters?
- Do You Want To Include Numerical Characters?
- Do You Want To Include Upper Cased Characters?
- Do You Want To Include Lower Cased Characters?
- Choose A Password Length

When the user has answered the above questions and entered a desired password length, the program will then generate a random password based on those parameters set out by the user.

This password will then be displayed on the web page like as follows:

![alt text](./README%20Imagery/Password-Screenshot.png)

Meanwhile, in the console, for reference purposes, some information is also printed like as follows:

All information shown on both the webpage and console from the clicking of the "Generate Password" button, will change each time a password is generated.
